# Ai_Agent_For_Smart_Farming_Advice
An intelligent AI-powered agent designed to assist farmers with real-time, data-driven agricultural recommendations. Built using IBM Cloud and watsonx.ai, this agent analyzes weather, soil, and crop data to provide personalized advice on irrigation, fertilization, pest control, and market trends.
🌾 AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice
An intelligent, multilingual AI agent designed to empower farmers with real-time, personalized agricultural guidance. Leveraging IBM watsonx.ai, BeeAI, and LangGraph, this agent integrates weather, soil, crop, and market data to deliver actionable insights—boosting productivity, sustainability, and profitability.

🎯 Project Motivation
Agriculture faces growing challenges: climate variability, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, and volatile market prices. Smallholder farmers often lack access to timely, localized advice. This project aims to bridge that gap by:
- Democratizing access to expert-level farming insights
- Supporting decision-making with AI-driven recommendations
- Promoting sustainable and data-informed agricultural practices
